#### Fonts

Font selection got a major upgrade.  Until now we had to refer to an individual font ttf.

Now `Font` acts like a query that searches for a matching `Font.Source`:

* `.font = .theme(.heading)`
* `.font = Font.theme(.heading).larger(2)`
* `.font = dvui.themeGet().font_mono.withWeight(.bold).withStyle(.italic)`

`dvui.Theme` has 4 fonts (body, heading, title, mono) and grew an `embedded_fonts` field so that font sources can be tied to the theme that requires them.

For now we still only have a single pool of `Font.Source` that is internal to dvui.  In the future we hope to extend this to be able to query for system fonts.

#### Syntax Highlighting

We are now bundling the tree-sitter library, and TextEntryWidget gained a `tree_sitter` option.

The usage code is responsible for providing:
* tree-sitter grammar
* queries strings (usually these are called "highlights.scm")
* list of matching capture names and `dvui.Options`

Right now an example is only in the main window of the "app" example (like `zig build sdl3-app`), but eventually we will figure out a way to integrate it into the demo window.

This integrates with `.cache_layout = true` to provide incremental edit parse updates and good performance on large documents.

Any feedback would be welcome!

#### More Improvements:

* dvui.dataSetDeinitFunction: can provide a callback for when some data is being trashed 
  * useful for tracking data allocated by a separate library
* expose more build-time options
  * stb_image
  * libc
  * freetype
  * tiny file dialogs
* fixed toast centering and visual glitches when multiple different sized toasts are together
* textEntry: textGet() return value stays valid after deinit()
* web: don't process ctrl-tab
  * in some browsers we were preventing ctrl-tab from switching tabs
* tree: allow animating a branch closing
* flexbox: add border_collapse and row/col
* raylib: updated dependency that fixes a lot of hidpi issues
* web: fix performance issue

Thank you to everyone who asked questions, filed issues, and contributed!
