## What is DVUI?
DVUI is a general purpose Zig GUI toolkit.

It is suitable for normal applications, or debugging windows in existing apps/games.

It has an **immediate mode API** but gives you all input events, so useable in **low and variable framerate** situations.

For applications DVUI can manage waiting for input so you only render frames when needed.
